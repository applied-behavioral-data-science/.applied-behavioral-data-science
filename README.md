# Applied Behavioral Data Science Collective

The Applied Behavioral Data Science Collective is a virtual student-led, beginner-friendly collaborative group focused on applied behavioral and social data analysis.

The collective emphasizes exploratory data analysis (EDA), interpretation, and shared learning over polished or production-level work. Projects begin with foundational techniques and gradually move toward more advanced concepts as members grow together.

This organization hosts collaborative pilot projects designed to support active participation and curiosity-driven exploration.
